\title{Plot Mother and Baby Score Global (SGLO)}
\usage{
sglo(sm = NULL, sw = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sm}{Plot Mother/Baby Score by Women. (Number of corn beans)}

\item{swm}{Plot Mother/Baby Score by Men. (Number of corn kernels)}
}
\description{
In Participatory Varietal Selection (PVS) is quite common calculate Plot Mother Score global which is the sum of 
Plot Mother/Baby Score by Men (sm) and Plot Mother/Baby Score by Women (sw). All these scores are provided by agricultors using the
number of corn kernels or beans for every genotype in the field.

#The global score : score_women + score_men
